# API Reference

This document lists every HTTP, WebSocket, and SSE endpoint exposed by the Solune backend. For interactive browsing and testing, start the backend with `ENABLE_DOCS=true` and visit `/api/docs` for the auto-generated OpenAPI interface.

All endpoints are prefixed with `/api/v1`. Unless noted, all endpoints require an active session cookie set by the OAuth flow. The `/health`, `/auth/github`, `/auth/github/callback`, and `/webhooks/github` endpoints are unauthenticated. The `/auth/dev-login` endpoint is also unauthenticated when `DEBUG=true`.

## Health

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/health` | Health check |

## Authentication

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/auth/github` | Initiate GitHub OAuth flow |
| GET | `/auth/github/callback` | OAuth callback handler |
| GET | `/auth/me` | Get current authenticated user |
| POST | `/auth/logout` | Logout and clear session |
| POST | `/auth/dev-login` | Dev-only PAT login (`DEBUG=true` only; JSON body requires a non-empty `github_token` up to 255 chars) |

## Projects

Project and board endpoints let you list, select, and subscribe to real-time updates from your GitHub Projects.

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/projects` | List user's GitHub Projects |
| GET | `/projects/{id}` | Get project details |
| GET | `/projects/{id}/tasks` | Get project tasks |
| POST | `/projects/{id}/select` | Select active project (starts polling) |
| WS | `/projects/{id}/subscribe` | WebSocket for real-time updates |
| GET | `/projects/{id}/events` | SSE fallback for real-time updates |

## Board

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/board/projects` | List projects with status field configuration |
| GET | `/board/projects/{project_id}` | Get board data (columns + items) |

## Chat

Chat endpoints power the conversational interface — send messages, receive AI responses, manage proposals, and use the `#agent` command to create custom agents inline.

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/chat/messages` | Get chat messages for session (supports `limit` and `offset` pagination) |
| POST | `/chat/messages` | Send message, get AI response (supports `#agent` command). Pass `ai_enhance=true` for streaming SSE via Agent Framework. Accepts optional `file_urls` and `pipeline_id` params |
| DELETE | `/chat/messages` | Clear chat history |
| POST | `/chat/proposals/{id}/confirm` | Confirm task proposal |
| DELETE | `/chat/proposals/{id}` | Cancel task proposal |
| POST | `/chat/upload` | Upload a file attachment |

### Streaming

When `ai_enhance=true`, the `POST /chat/messages` endpoint returns a streaming SSE (Server-Sent Events) response instead of a single JSON object. The client receives incremental events as the agent generates its response.

| Event | Data | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `token` | Partial text string | Incremental text content from the agent |
| `tool_call` | Tool name + arguments | Agent is invoking a registered tool |
| `tool_result` | Tool output + action payload | Tool execution completed |
| `done` | Final `ChatMessage` JSON | Stream complete, includes the full message |
| `error` | Error message string | An error occurred during streaming |

> **Rate limit**: Streaming requests are subject to rate limiting. The standard per-user rate limit applies.

### File Upload Constraints

The `POST /chat/upload` endpoint and `file_urls` parameter on `POST /chat/messages` are subject to the following constraints:

| Constraint | Value |
|------------|-------|
| Maximum file size | 10 MB per file |
| Maximum files per message | 5 |
| Allowed types | Images, PDFs, plain text, CSV, VTT, SRT, common document formats |
| Blocked types | Executables, archives, system files |
| Transcript auto-detection | `.vtt` and `.srt` files are automatically detected as transcripts |

### `#agent` Command

Send `#agent <description> #<status-name>` via chat or Signal to create a custom GitHub agent:

- Fuzzy status column matching (`#in-review`, `#InReview`, `#IN_REVIEW`)
- AI-generated preview with natural language edit loop
- 8-step pipeline: save config → create column → create issue → create branch → commit files → open PR → move to In Review → update pipeline mappings
