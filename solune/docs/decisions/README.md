# Architecture Decision Records

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) capture the key design decisions made during Solune's development — what was decided, why, and what alternatives were considered. We publish these to provide transparency into the project's technical direction and to help contributors understand the reasoning behind the codebase.

## Format

```markdown
## Context
What situation or problem drove this decision?

## Decision
What was decided, and what alternatives were considered?

## Consequences
What are the trade-offs, benefits, and known limitations?
```
