    Check if a Copilot agent completed work directly on the main PR.

    Subsequent agents work on the existing PR branch (not creating a new PR).
    This function detects completion by checking multiple signals:
      1. If the main PR is no longer a draft (Copilot marks it ready when done)
      2. If the main PR has copilot_work_finished or review_requested events
         that occurred after the pipeline started
      3. If new commits exist on the branch (HEAD SHA changed since agent was
         assigned) AND Copilot is no longer assigned to the issue — indicating
         the agent pushed commits and finished its session

    Signal 3 is critical for subsequent agents that push to the existing branch.
    GitHub does not always fire copilot_work_finished timeline events when
    Copilot works on an already-open PR branch.

    IMPORTANT: Copilot is assigned to the agent's *sub-issue*, NOT the parent
    issue.  All Copilot assignment checks must use sub_issue_number to avoid
    false negatives that cause premature completion detection.

    Args:
        access_token: GitHub access token
        owner: Repository owner
        repo: Repository name
        main_pr_number: The main PR number to check
        issue_number: GitHub issue number (for logging)
        agent_name: Name of the agent we're checking completion for
        pipeline_started_at: When the pipeline was started (used to filter
            stale events from earlier agents)
        agent_assigned_sha: The HEAD SHA captured when the agent was assigned.
            If empty, commit-based detection is skipped.
        sub_issue_number: The sub-issue where Copilot is actually assigned.
            If provided, Copilot assignment is checked on this issue instead
            of the parent.  Falls back to parent if not provided.
